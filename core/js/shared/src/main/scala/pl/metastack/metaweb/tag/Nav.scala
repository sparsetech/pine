A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents."><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></a> element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" title="The HTML Navigation Element (<nav>) represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links."><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></a> element.</li>
